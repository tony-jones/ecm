5.2 Overriding your first view
Refinery comes with a rake task called refinery:override which allows you to copy files out of Refinery and into your own application to change.

 $ rake refinery:override view=refinery/pages/show
    create  app/views/refinery/pages/show.html.erb

    6.2 Generating an extension
    Refinery ships with an extension generator that makes adding your own functionality a breeze. It works just like the Rails scaffold generator.

     $ rails generate refinery:engine singular_model_name attribute:type [attribute


     WORDPRESS

     - wordpress is designed for blogs
     - security issues, plugins not standardized
     - hard to customize, pages breaking.

     DRUPAL

     - Drupal takes more configuration but its extendability is great
     -It is a more professional platform in my opinion in terms of security like modules

     REFINERY

     - Will meet our needs because we have complete control over javascript, controllers, and app code
     - refinery ships with extension generator rails (generate refinery:engine)
     - rake task to copy out files of Refinery and into your own app to change. (rake refinery:override)
